<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In modern software development, managing code versions, collaborating with others, and keeping track of changes is essential. Git, a widely used version control system, allows developers to do just that. In this stage, you will start by setting up a local copy of a remote Git repository. This is a common first step when joining a new project or contributing to an existing one. You will clone a repository, fetch all remote branches, switch to a specific development branch, and verify that all the needed branches are available.</p>

<p>By completing this stage, you will have a local repository synchronized with the remote repository. This way, you will ensure you are working with the latest code and on the correct branch. These steps are critical in real-world projects where multiple developers collaborate and work on different branches simultaneously.</p>

<p>[ALERT-warning] You may corrupt the repository while working on this project. It may be helpful to understand the status of the repository and branches. The commands <code>git branch --all</code>&nbsp;and <code>git log --oneline</code> can help you view branches and&nbsp;the commit history.&nbsp; If you want to start over, you can clone the repository again.</p>

<p>[/ALERT]</p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s break this task into steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>
        <p>Open a terminal and clone the remote Git repository to your local machine at&nbsp;the project root. This will create a local copy of the remote repository. You can either use SSH or HTTPS:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>For SSH: <code>git@github.com:hyperskill-content/Safety-net-study-repository.git</code></li>
            <li>For HTTPS: <code>https://github.com/hyperskill-content/Safety-net-study-repository.git</code></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>After cloning, move into the newly created repository directory to work with the project files;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>Switch to a development branch: <code>0.2.x-dev</code> to work on the latest development code.&nbsp; Ensure you create a local copy from the remote;</p>
    </li>
    <li>
        <p>List all available branches in your local repository to confirm that the correct branches are present;</p>
    </li>
</ul>
