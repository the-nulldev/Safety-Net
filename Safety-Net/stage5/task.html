<h2>Description</h2>

<p>Now that your main codebase is stable, let's focus on another essential task in collaborative software development: restoring files to a previous state. This is a common scenario when unwanted or incorrect changes have been introduced into a codebase. You may often need to revert specific files or entire sections of a project back to a known, stable version. This ability to &quot;undo&quot; changes is crucial in maintaining code quality and stability, especially when working with multiple collaborators on a shared repository.</p>

<p>Your colleagues have accidentally introduced unrequested features into the&nbsp;<code>feature/case</code>&nbsp;branch. Your task is to help them by restoring the <code>case_operations.py</code> file to a previous commit and committing the changes with a clear and descriptive message. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s break this task into clear steps:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Switch to the&nbsp;<code>feature/case</code>&nbsp;branch: create a local copy of <code>feature/case</code>&nbsp;from the remote repository;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Restore&nbsp;<code>case_operations.py</code>&nbsp;to a previous state: using the commit&nbsp;<code>6b2ec72</code>, restore the file&nbsp;<code>case_operations.py</code>&nbsp;to its state from that commit. This will undo changes that were made from the point;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Commit the changes: after restoring the file, stage and commit the changes with the following commit message:&nbsp;<code>refactor: restored case operations from 6b2ec72</code>;</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Verify the branch: ensure that the&nbsp;<code>feature/case</code>&nbsp;branch contains the correct number of commits and that the restored file matches the content from the&nbsp;<code>6b2ec72</code>&nbsp;commit.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
