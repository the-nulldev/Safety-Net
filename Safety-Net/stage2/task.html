<h2>Description</h2>

<p>In this stage, you will delve deeper into feature development. In our project, new features are developed in isolated branches to avoid conflicts with the main codebase. This approach is critical for maintaining code stability and ensuring that new features are thoroughly tested before being merged into the main branch.&nbsp;</p>

<p>Your task is to create a new feature branch from an existing development branch, create a new file, implement a simple mathematical function, and commit the changes. This process mirrors real-world software development practices where teams work on new features in separate branches and merge them together when done. </p>

<h2>Objectives</h2>

<p>Let&#39;s break this task into steps:</p>

<ul>
    <li>Create a new branch named <code>feature/math</code>&nbsp;from the existing <code>0.2.x-dev</code>&nbsp;branch. This branch will serve as the isolated environment where you will add new functionality. Ensure that this new branch is active before proceeding to the next steps;</li>
    <li>In the newly created <code>feature/math</code>&nbsp;branch, create a file named <code>math_operations.py</code>&nbsp;in <code>root</code>&nbsp;directory of the project.</li>
    <li>The file should contain a basic mathematical function that performs the addition of two integers and returns the result:&nbsp;&nbsp; &nbsp;</li>
</ul>

<pre>
<code class="language-python">        def addition(a, b):
            return a + b
</code>
</pre>

<ul>
</ul>

<ul>
    <li>Stage and commit changes with the commit message &mdash;&nbsp;<code>feat: new function addition</code></li>
    <li>At this point, there should be a total of 4 commits in the <code>feature/math</code>&nbsp;branch, including the one you just made;</li>
</ul>
